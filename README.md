# httpChat
A messaging (web)-app where everyone can message, without registering or installing anything. The server never knows who send a message for a particular person. You can access it from any broswer or terminal--everywhere HTTP works. You can create a forward list, where messages will be automatically forwarded to that location. you can build extentions on top of it. You may even have your own client app, we only transfer the messages.
